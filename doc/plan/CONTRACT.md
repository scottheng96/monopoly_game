# Team Contract

### We all agree to the following:
1. Meetings
    * Weekly meetings will be held on Thursdays 9:30pm-12am
    * Once broken down further, daily optional front end and back end meetings
    * Team member should post in group chat that they can’t make it - be reasonable, don’t text after the meeting has started

2. Communication
    * Primary means of communication will be the Messenger group
    * Respond as soon as you can to any groupchat messages. 

3. Helping hands
    * We confirmed we would ask for help when needed.
    * Every team member is going to go above and beyond the needed support. 
    * We also confirmed we would support each other to the best of our abilities. 

4. Commitments
    * We confirm that we will do our best
    * If a member fails to meet their commitments, they need to clearly communicate what issues stood (or stand) in the way of the commitment being met. They should reach out to appropriate parties within the team for assistance and the team should respond in a helpful manner which still enables the member to be the one completing their part.
    * Below is our step by step plan to address failures: 
        1. First failure occurs
        2. Team meeting to discuss failure
        3. Failure persists
        4. Team meeting to discuss future steps, but at this point it is not unreasonable to contact the professors
