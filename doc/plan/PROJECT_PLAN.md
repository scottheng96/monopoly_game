Project Plans

We will implement the following features for backend: systems which allow the user to buy, to sell, and 
to trade properties (Leah, Jordan); a player system which allows the players to move on the board, doing specific actions 
when they land on each spot, such as buying a propertySpace, picking up a card, or going to the jail.
and to be influenced by different types of wildcards (Leah, Jordan, Qinzhe); a map system that 
contains a linked-list of locations (Leah, Qinzhe); a file reader/writer that allow the user to start a new game, 
to load the previous game, and to save the current game (Qinzhe). 
We will also implement the following features for frontend: a control panel at the beginning which allows the user 
to choose different tokens (James, Scott); a control panel that allows the user to do trading and other stuff 
when the game is in progress (James, Scott, Arilia); several nice looking maps (Arilia).

Jordan and Leah will be responsible for the backend. Arilia and Scott will be responsible for the frontend.
Qinzhe and James will work on both parts, but Qinzhe will primarily focus on the backend, while James will primarily focus on the frontend.

We also plan to accomplish all the challenge features by the end of Sprint 3.

What we plan to show at the Midpoint Demo is a playable game without all the features we have planned. 
At the Midpoint Demo, we will have a complete system for the user to choose different tokens. We will also have at 
least one map. The players will be able to move in the board while the jail system will probably not be able to work, 
but their basic movement will be guaranteed. The players will be able to do basic trading activities including but not 
limited to buying a location, receiving rental fees from a location, etc. The control panel when the game is in progress 
will be completed. Through it, users can roll the dice, move forward, buy and sell their properties, check their properties 
at anytime during the game, and restart, save and load the game at anytime they want.
